- [Estimate by product decomposition]

# Estimation approach
<Consider the EZGas  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course>
# Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |NC = 16 |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |       A = 115                     | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | S = NC*A = 16*115 = 1840 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  | 10 LOC/1ph -> E = 184 ph                                     |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) |C = 30 euro*148.5 ph = 5520  euro | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |    32 ph/day * 5 day/week = 160 ph/week<br> 184  ph / 160 ph/week = 1.15 weeks  = 1 week and 1 day  |
